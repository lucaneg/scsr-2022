	// the code below is outside of the scope of the course. You can uncomment it to get
	// your code to compile. Beware that the code is written expecting that a field named 
	// "sign" containing an enumeration (similar to the one saw during class) exists in 
	// this class: if you name it differently, change also the code below to make it work 
	// by just using the name of your choice instead of "sign"
